# Rockbuster_Analysis
A SQL based project that investigates online movie rental data for the fictitious company, Rockbuster Stealth LLC, as part of the CareerFoundry Data Analysis course.

## Objective
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services, Rockbuster is planning to use its existing movie licenses to an online video rental service in order to remain relevant in a competitive industry. The purpose of this analysis is to provide insight on the current customer base and rental patterns to support a successful launch strategy.

## Tools
Postgre SQL was used via the pgAdmin 4 app for all data analysis. Excel was used to present sql outputs and queries to technical colleagues. Google Sheets was used to create a data dictionary. Powerpoint was used to create a final presentation for the Rockbuster business managers.

## Data
All data was supplied by CareerFoundry as part of an assignment for its Data Analysis course. The full data set can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BAUIbWNg1WxBqH0wjvy57lVyyZGqSIka/view?usp=sharing).
